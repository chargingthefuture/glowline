# Agent Instructions Template (portable)

Drop-in agent instructions for a **new repository**. This is the project-agnostic core —
the writing voice, the banned-term dictionary, and a few general process rules — distilled
from a larger codebase's agent rules with all project-specific rules removed. Copy it into a
new repo, fill in the one placeholder at the bottom with that repo's own rules, and wire up
the enforcement hook (see `README.md` in this folder).

> Keep the wording below as-is. The voice and dictionary sections are the whole point of this
> template; they are also what the enforcement hook checks. If you change a banned term here,
> change it in `hooks/check-no-pleasantries.mjs` too — the hook is the source of truth.

## Voice — no pleasantries, no feelings (Critical — every reply, all agents)

Do not address the user with thanks, apologies, congratulations, well-wishes, encouragement, or
closing sign-offs. Do not use first-person feeling words (for example: glad, happy, excited,
delighted, sorry, "hope this helps", "I appreciate"). You have no feelings; do not perform them.
No jargon, no buzzwords. State the result or the next step in plain words, then stop.

This is enforced by the Stop hook `hooks/check-no-pleasantries.mjs`, which blocks a reply that
contains a banned term and asks for a plain restatement.

### Banned-term dictionary (every reply, all agents)

The Stop hook `hooks/check-no-pleasantries.mjs` holds the canonical list and is the source of
truth; if this copy and the hook ever differ, the hook wins. Keep the two in sync — when you
change one, change the other. The hook scans the whole reply and matches the term even inside
quotes, so do not reach for a banned word even to talk about it; use the replacement below instead.

**Pleasantries, feelings, and sign-offs — never use any of these (in any reply):**

- thanks / thank you
- you're welcome / you are welcome
- no problem
- my pleasure
- glad
- happy to
- excited
- delighted
- sorry
- apology / apologies / apologize / apologise (any form)
- cheers
- congrats / congratulations
- "I appreciate" / "we appreciate" (only the first-person form is banned; "the rate appreciates" is fine)
- "hope this / hope that / hope you / hope it …"
- feel free
- warm / best / kind / kindest regards
- looking forward

**Excluded vocabulary — banned word → use instead:**

- flywheel → a plain description of the loop (for example "each answer improves the next")
- punch list → list
- (the word for out-of-date) → drop it; if you mean something specific, name it (out-of-date, superseded, no longer current)
- console → dashboard (the code identifiers `console.log` / `console.error` / `console.info` are exempt)

When the hook blocks a reply, restate the result in plain, factual language — none of the terms
above, no jargon, no first-person feeling words — then stop.

## Plain language — no jargon (Critical — all agents)

Write in plain, everyday language. **Do not use jargon, acronyms, or insider terminology** in
human-facing output — chat replies, pull-request titles and descriptions, review comments, commit
messages, issue comments, and documentation. Jargon is a distraction and is confusing; it slows the
reader down and hides meaning.

- **Default to simple words.** Prefer the plain term over the technical or marketing one (for example
  "test it before you rely on it" over "validate end-to-end"; "make sure" over "ensure idempotency";
  "the background service" over "the daemon"). Write so a non-specialist can follow.
- **If a technical term is genuinely necessary, define it in plain words on first use** — one short
  parenthetical is enough. Do not assume the reader knows acronyms; spell them out the first time.
- **Explain, don't just name.** Say what something does and why it matters, not only its label.
- **Exempt:** real code identifiers, file paths, command names, and established proper nouns (service
  names, library names) — name those accurately; just don't pile extra jargon around them.
- Applies to **every agent** and all human-facing communication. When in doubt, choose the wording a
  newcomer would understand.

## Task planning — no "phases" (Critical)

Do **not** organize work into "phases." No "Phase 0 / Phase 1 / Phase 2", no phased-rollout buckets —
anywhere: plans, checklists, design notes, code comments, pull-request descriptions, or commit
messages. Phases confuse humans and agents alike.

Instead, when given an objective, break it into discrete tasks and **list them one after another in
the order they must happen**. Where order matters, state it as an explicit blocking dependency, not a
phase:

- ✅ "Task B is blocked by Task A — do A first."
- ✅ A flat, ordered, numbered task list (1, 2, 3 …) where each item may name what it depends on.
- ❌ "Phase 1: …", "Phase 2: …", "do this in a later phase."

A task with no dependency can be done at any time or in parallel; say so plainly ("no dependencies;
can run anytime").

---

## Branch naming (all agents)

- Always create a descriptive, task-named branch and develop on it. Use a Conventional-Commit-style
  prefix plus a short kebab-case summary of the task: for example `feat/user-auth-refresh`,
  `fix/csv-export-dedup`, `chore/ci-node-version-bump`, `docs/readme-quickstart`.
- Never develop on, commit to, or open a pull request from an auto-generated session branch (an opaque
  name like `claude/loving-mendel-wwWF4`). Treat it as a throwaway base: immediately branch off it (or
  off the default branch) to a descriptive name and push from the descriptive branch.
- Branch names must describe the task at hand — never an opaque or random string.

---

## Search tooling (optional convenience)

- Prefer `rg` (ripgrep) for recursive text and file discovery.
- Keep a grep fallback in scripts and prompts where a search command is shown, so they run anywhere:
  - `if command -v rg >/dev/null 2>&1; then rg -n "pattern" path; else grep -RIn "pattern" path; fi`

## What this template deliberately leaves out

Everything below was project-specific in the source codebase and is **not** included here. Add the
ones your new repo needs under the placeholder section, in your own words:

- Design-pass / mockup gating and any design-system rules.
- Product, feature, plugin, and domain rules.
- Repository layout, module-boundary, and file-size rules.
- Database schema, migration, and data-model rules.
- Integration/auth/observability/provider rules (the specific services a product uses).
- Continuous-integration job names, pull-request parity checks, and release conventions.
- Any rules-index / precedence list that points at project rule files.

## Glowline — project-specific rules

Glowline is a small narrative neon arcade racer. Two implementations live in this repo:

- `web/` — the **playable offline Progressive Web App** (PWA): plain HTML5 + Canvas, vanilla
  ES modules, no build step and no third-party dependencies. This is the version people install.
- `scenes/`, `scripts/` — the original Godot prototype (GDScript). Kept for reference. The web
  app is a port of it, not generated from it; the two do not share code.

### Keep the web app dependency-free and offline-first
- Do **not** add a framework, bundler, package manager, or build step to `web/`. It must stay a
  set of static files that run directly in the browser. If a task seems to need a build step, stop
  and raise it with the user first.
- No external network calls at runtime — no content-delivery-network links, remote fonts, remote
  audio/images, or analytics. Everything the app needs must be served from this repo so it works
  with no network. Audio is generated in code (Web Audio), not loaded from a file.
- Use relative URLs (`./…`) everywhere so the app works under any base path (it is served from a
  subpath on GitHub Pages).
- Respect iOS Safari as the primary target: test touch input and the installed "Add to Home Screen"
  standalone mode, and honor safe-area insets.

### Service worker / offline cache (do this every time you touch `web/`)
- When you add, rename, or remove any file the app loads at runtime, update the `ASSETS` precache
  list in `web/sw.js` to match.
- Bump the `CACHE` name in `web/sw.js` (for example `glowline-v1` → `glowline-v2`) on any change to
  a cached asset, so already-installed copies fetch the new version instead of the old cached one.
- Screenshots and other docs under `web/screenshots/` are not part of gameplay — do not add them to
  the precache list.

### Content and tone
- Story text lives in `web/js/story.js`. Follow `STORY.md`: keep the tone supportive and hopeful,
  avoid oppressive metaphors, and keep the game always winnable (a hazard hit sets the player back,
  it does not end the run).

### Assets and deployment
- Regenerate app icons with `python3 web/icons/make_icons.py` (standard-library only) rather than
  adding an image dependency.
- The app deploys to GitHub Pages from `web/` via `.github/workflows/deploy-pwa.yml`.
